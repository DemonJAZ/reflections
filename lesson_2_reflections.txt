What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden folder named .git , and enables version-control in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area prepares the files to be committed , its like putting chocolates in a box and then sending it out.
